# Quick Intructions
#
# 1. Configure the authentication backend in the settings.py file:
#
# AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
#    'djangosaml2.backends.Saml2Backend',
#    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
#)
#
# 2. Set the login url in the settings.py and include the urls:
#
# settings.py:
# ...
# LOGIN_URL = '/saml2/login/'
# ...
#
# urls.py:
# ...
# (r'^saml2/', include('djangosaml2.urls')),
# ...
#
# 3. Set the pysaml configuration in the SAML_CONFIG constant of the
# settings.py file. It is basically a big dictionary with plenty of options.
# Check pysaml2 docs for more information about the configuration dictionary.
#
# SAML_CONFIG = { ... }
#
# 4. Set the attribute that links the saml identity with the Django username
#
# SAML_USERNAME_ATTRIBUTE = 'uid'
